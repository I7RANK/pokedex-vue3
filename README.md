## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Decisions

### üêæ Fetching All Pok√©mon Instead of Using Offset

I decided to fetch **all Pok√©mon at once** and store them in the global state.  
The reason behind this is that the **search feature** needed to look through every Pok√©mon, not just the ones currently displayed on screen.

After checking the API, I noticed there wasn‚Äôt an endpoint for searching directly by name or filtering results, so **loading everything upfront** made more sense for this use case.

Additionally, the **response time was fast enough**, so fetching them all at once didn‚Äôt negatively impact performance.

### ‚≠ê LocalStorage for Favorites

I implemented **favorites persistence** using **LocalStorage** to keep user preferences between sessions.  
This way, Pok√©mon marked as favorites remain stored even after a page reload ‚Äî without needing any backend.

---

### üß± Folder Structure

I decided to organize the logic into folders such as **services**, **adapters**, and **utils** to keep the architecture modular and scalable.

- **services** ‚Üí handle API requests
- **adapters** ‚Üí transform data into a consistent app format
- **utils** ‚Üí reusable helper functions

This approach improves **testability** and **long-term maintainability**.
